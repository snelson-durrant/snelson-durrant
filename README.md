#### Hi, I'm Nelson Durrant ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science at Brigham Young University. I have the most experience with Python and C++, but am familiar with bash, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. I enjoy reading (my favorites are books by Tolstoy or Dostoevsky), playing tennis, and robotics. I'm especially interested in BCI and medical device engineering and security.
