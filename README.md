#### Hi, I'm Nelson Durrant ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at Brigham Young University and working in the BYU FRoSt Lab doing research on multi-agent underwater robotic mapping and localization. Besides engineering, I enjoy reading (my favorites are books by Joyce or Dostoevsky), playing tennis, fly fishing, and experimenting with DIY robotics.
