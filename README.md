#### Hi, I'm Nelson Durrant ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at Brigham Young University and working with a team in the BYU FRoSt Lab to design and build low-cost autonomous underwater vehicles. Outside of school, I enjoy reading (my favorites are books by Joyce or Dostoevsky), playing tennis, working on home-grown robotics projects, and fly fishing.
