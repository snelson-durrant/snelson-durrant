#### Hi, I'm Nelson Durrant ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science at Brigham Young University. I have the most experience with Python, Java, and C++, but I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I enjoy reading (my favorites are books by Tolstoy or Dostoevsky), playing tennis, and hobby robotics. I'm especially interested in BCI engineering and medical robotics, and I'm looking for possible related summer internships -- I'd love to join a team and start contributing.
