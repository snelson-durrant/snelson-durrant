#### Hi, I'm Nelson Durrant ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science at Brigham Young University. I have the most experience with C/C++, Python, and Java, but I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and SQL. I enjoy reading (my favorites are books by Tolstoy or Dostoevsky), playing tennis, and hobby robotics. I'm especially interested in machine learning and autonomous robotics, and I'm looking for related summer internships -- I'd love to join a team and start contributing.
